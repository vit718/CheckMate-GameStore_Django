# CheckMate GameStore

Welcome to my project, an e-commerce website that focuses on selling board games. CheckMate is a fictional store that relies on online sales alone to make revenue.
This project uses the Django framework, HTML, Python, CSS and JavaScript.

In this project, I set up an authentication system and provided access to the site's data for users to purchase various products.

CRUD functionality (Create, Read, Update, Delete) is implemented in the Reviews page, Products Management page, Cart page and the Admin section of the project.
